The overall goal of the application is to emulate the main mechanics of the physical board game, and to ensure that they are working correctly. ...The secondary goal is to add more advanced mechanics (if possible) ...

#### A list of requirements for the system based on the high level requirements reviewed in lecture:

- player(spiller)
- fied for movement(bevegelsesfelt)
- special tile with attributes(spesialrute)
- flag (flagg)

- Tiles
- list of objects on the Tile
- Board parent object/interface

Rules for the board:

#### Consider important aspects of the process. For example, how to 
organize meetings, definitions and assignment tasks, follow-ups, which 
software development activities are needed (and when), which design 
activities are needed (and when). Write a brief description of the 
process in the process and project plan.

##### PROCESS AND PROJECT PLAN

Meeting 2 times per week (mondays and thursday). Base our project on 
mainly Scrum and Kanban, and decided to implement pair-programming as 
well as working separately. In the meetings we will assign task on what 
to do in the meeting as well as what to work on until next meeting. at 
the end of the meeting we will review how it works and what we can 
improve and so on.
