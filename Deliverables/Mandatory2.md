## Mandatory Assignment 2 (Group 4 Team 1)

#### Perform a short project retrospective and discuss what went well, what did not work as expected, what (if any) did not work at all, and any new activities or tools that the team will test during the next exercise (oblig 3).

#### Discuss why things worked or did not work. Write a brief summary of the discussion, and load up to the team repo. At the end of this you can make a small assessment of how good you were. This can be used to adjust how many tasks you intend to get into the next iteration, which is then delivered with oblig 3.

##### Good: 
- git worked well 
- focused on people understanding git before coding
- github and projectboard is clean and understandable 
- pair programming
- communicated well 

##### Not so good: 
- graphics did not work that well and require a little bit more time to understand how things work
- a bit of confusion of which task people where working on, should be more specific about which task you are working on
- use slack more frequent (tools)
- focus more on tests
- steep learning curve
- Gradle

##### Assessment of how good we were: 

In the start of this project we focused on everyone understanding the task and how to use git. This worked well as everyone were on the same page and it helped when we started coding. We have had a meeting where we pair-programmed some core classes. We felt this was a good way to work and we will continue having pair-programming meetings. We have focused a lot on communication and we will continue to do so as it works. In the future we will use slack more frequently and just make sure everyone is up to date. 

We had some problems with graphics and hopefully we will be able to understand it more in time. We should be even more specific on which tasks people are working on and be more consistent on assigning people to tasks in the project board. We will also focus more on testing in the next assignment. 

We also have some problems with Gradle. We didn’t use the Maven template from the repository, we just downloaded the libgdx development package and started working with it. But after some time we encountered several problems such as test that are not working and low stability of the project overall. We plan to migrate to Maven after the first assignment because we don’t want to change everything last minute.

To conclude we think we did well when it comes to communicating face to face and helping everyone understand git and so on. We did well when it comes to pair programming and helping each other.  We could improve on testing, using slack and using the project board more effectively.
