Worked on shrinking the game board to add some space for the cards. Searched for the images for the movement cards and added them to our repo, and added method for getting image from card objects. Discussed the process of reading the input from the user to determine which card was chosen, so it can be saved in the list of chosen cards. used buttons with references to its card to add the selected cards to a list.
